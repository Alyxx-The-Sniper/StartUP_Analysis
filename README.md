In this project, We help answer important questions such as:

- Is the company in good financial health?
- Does the company need to let go of any employees?
- Should the company allow employees to work from home permanently?

I used different analysis technique such as:

- Visualization (plotly, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Statistical analysis (biviriate, unibiriate etc.)
- K-Means Clustering

More project on my 'Data Science' repo.. ;)
